\section{Task 2.1}



A conflict set contains components where we assume that they all work. So for problem1 a possible conflict set was $CS_1 = {a1}$. So we assume that component a1 works. The inputs were given to be both 1, thus for an and gate we would predict the output to be 1 as well, however we were given that the output was 0. So we can consume there is a $\bot$ and thus a1 correctly belongs to the conflict set.
